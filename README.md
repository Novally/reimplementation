This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I created this project by typing 'npm start' into my consol (Listed below) on the Create React App.  I have all the files stored in a file named Reimplementation.  Compiling the documents - I personally used VSCode - and running the app should give you the same results. 

There should be no errors on the Webpage outcome!

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
